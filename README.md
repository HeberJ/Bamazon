# Bamazon

The Bamazon shows users the current items available for purchase. The user will be prompted a list to select the item they wish to purchase and how many items they wish to purchase.

If the item is in stock, the purchase will finish and the user will see the total amount of their purchase. If the item is not in stock Bamazon will notify that it does not have enough in stock, and will show them what they requested and how many items are actually in stock.
